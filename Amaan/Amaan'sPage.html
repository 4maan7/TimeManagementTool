<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h1>
</div>
<div class="textboxL">
<p>My fascination for Computing stemmed from hardware and circuits.
   Watching YouTube videos, I built my own computer whilst also understanding the functionality of each of the components.
   The availability of a computer gave me a plethora of possibilities and I decided to begin designing web pages by learning JavaScript and HTML independently,
   motivating me to broaden my knowledge and demonstrates my passion for coding.
   As I became more interested in Cyber Security I used my computer to create a virtual machine where I could observe how malware operates
    and interacts with the OS. With further research using a website called Udemy, I began sandbox testing my very own forms of viruses as it provided
    visualization on how malicious code would behave in an isolated desktop environment. From this I understood how a virus tries to gain access to
    applications in order to duplicate and spread. To challenge myself and develop my public speaking skills I competed in the 'Jack Petchey' Foundation's 'Speak Out Challenge'. I delivered a motivational speech on how the youth should deal with the obstacle’s society throws at them and placed 4th within the borough. I am excited at the prospect of studying Computer Science and having the opportunity to continue my quest for knowledge as well as taking an important step towards my goal of a career in Computer Science.<p/>

  <div class="textbox2">
  <p>As a group leader my main role is to organise group meetings which are a useful tool as it gives an opportunity  for each member in the group to brainstorm ideas and share any solutions they may have. Moreover, as the group leader I also complete the documentation on behalf of the group. This includes meeting notes on any work or discussion we may have, also includes screenshots of evidence of work the group completed alongside a short explanation on how we performed the task. In addition, communication is key and as group leader I ensure that everyone knows what their role is and meet deadlines. If there are any questions I can relay the queries to necessary team member.<p/>

      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Hobbies & Interests</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
      <p>From a very young age i've always enjoyed the sport of football and try to play with friends as regularly as possible.
        I also am a fan of Chelsea F.C and have watched a few matches at our ground Stamford Bridge. Another interest I have is computer systems;
        I am fascinated by how their work and in my free time I watch youtube tutorials on building computer systems
        which eventually lead to me building my own gaming pc.
         In my free time I enjoy weight training as it helps to improve my strength and overall fitness and is a hobby that I thoroughly. Another one of my favourite things to do is travel; I have been to several places such as: Egypt, Turkey, Dubai and France just to name a few. My most recent trip was to Turkey in 2022 with some of my friends after a stressful A-Level period. We did numerous activities like quadbiking, a jeep safari through the mountains and a cable car ride to an old castle. In the future we hope to all visit Morocco for another holiday!<p/>

          <p>One project I completed was an application for a game which is based on the show ‘Who wants to be a millionaire?’ as well as Quizlet.
             It was primarily developed to help students who struggle with the repetitive teaching and learning methods
             used in the modern day,creating this ensured students could effectively revise school content in a fun and engaging way.
           Some features I implemeted to make this platform interactive for the users were life lines such as hints which would help the users
           if they were to get stuck on a question which allowed them to learn efficiently. I developed this game using python using the module
           pygame.<p/>
