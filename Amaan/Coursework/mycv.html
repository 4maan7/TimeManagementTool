        <h2>About Me <i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i></h2>
        <p>I am a hardworking driven individual who is always organized and capable of
          managing multiple workloads.I have experience working in and
          leading teams whilst also being able to work independently.
           Also, I believe I have excellent communication skills and good judgement.
         I have a strong fascination of computting which stemmed from hardware and circuits. Watching YouTube videos,
         I built my own computer whilst also understanding the functionality of each of the components.
       The availibity of a computer gave me a plethora of possibilites and I decided to selef stufy the programming
     language python which further motivated me to broaden my knowledge and demoonstrtes my passion for coding.
   Another one of my passions would include public speaking. To challenge myself and develop my public speaking skills
   I competed in the The <abbr title="Jack Petchey' Foundation's 'Speak Out Challenge">JPSOC</abbr> and delivered a motivational speech on how
   the youth should deal with the obstacle’s society throws at them and placed 4th within the borough. </p>

          <h2>Programming Portfolio <i class="fa-solid fa-keyboard"></i></h2>
          <p>One project I completed was an application for a game which is based on the show ‘Who wants to be a millionaire?’ as well as Quizlet.
             It was primarily developed to help students who struggle with the repetitive teaching and learning methods
             used in the modern day,creating this ensured students could effectively revise school content in a fun and engaging way.
           Some features I implemeted to make this platform interactive for the users were life lines such as hints which would help the users
           if they were to get stuck on a question which allowed them to learn efficiently. I developed this game using python using the module
           pygame.</p>
