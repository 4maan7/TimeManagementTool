          <h2>Work Experience - </h2>
          <p>
            During the first half of my gap year and the summer before coming to University,
            I had worked full time at a small restaurant called Thai street cafe in Newmarket.
            I was mainly just a waiter but due the nature of a small independent business,
            I would rotate being the barman,
            checking and ordering stock and in the latter part of my experience closing up the till.
          </p>

          <p>
            Previously, at the end of secondary school, where I was a school ambassador and sports leader,
            I was also a waiter for Newmarket Jockey Club Catering, under Compass Group.
            For my work experience, in year 10, I commuted to a neighbouring village workshop, Thurlow Nunn Standen Kennett.

          <h2>Skill Set - </h2>
          <p>
            Leadership - I was an Air Cadet, who rose to the rank of Sergeant.
            As a senior noncommissioned officer(NCOs),
            I had to go on courses to develop my leadership as I was expected to lead the younger cadets and junior NCOs.
            Problem solving
          </p>
          <p>
            Responsible and reliable - as mentioned above I was a senior NCO who had to take responsibility for the cadets in my squadron.
            In addition to setting a goodexample for the younger cadets to look up to, being puntual, knowledgable and always present.
            Further more during my work at the Thai Street Cafe. I had to close up the till (counting up the gross and net profits)
            and open up and lock the restaurant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teamwork - being part of a team at the air cadets and work, I had to also work as part of an extracurricular team of four stem students,
            at Hills Road, where we were awarded a gold industrial cadet award for EDT's EES project.
            As it was mainly self regulated, we had to organise the work and time ourselves,
            especially as the pandemic hit, during the latter half of the project's six month time frame of October to April.
          </p>
