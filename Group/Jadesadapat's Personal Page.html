              <p>
                My name is Jadey (Jadesadapat Pongnop), I born in Thailand but raised in England;
                studying, foundation year Computer Science and Mathematics student at City,
                University of London. I have graduated from Hills Road Sixthform College in Cambridge and Newmarket Academy,
                a secondary school in Newmarket. In the team I was one of the main developers for "focus".

              <p>
                As a main developer I was tasked with developing a part of focus's time management tool,
                mainly focusing on the dash board page.
                Which is a page to display how you distributed your time, in hours, over a week.
                The page is broken down with statistics and graphs and charts.

                  <p>
                    I enjoy playing badminton Im not apart of any club or team in london but I look forward to playing socially.
                    Additionally, I have been trying to get into football as it is just the most popular sport and probably the easiest icebreaker,
                    especially for male uni students
                  </p>
                </li>

                  Fishing
                  <p>
                    A friend of mine got me into fishing over the past year.
                    I admit it is quite a niche hobby to have but I really like how slow and therapeutic it is.
                    It is definitely not the most active activity
                    but a nice thing to do in the background while you catch up with some friends.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gaming
                  <p>
                    I do like videogames, mainly pc games, just because I prefer keyboard and mouse
                    but I don't get to play too often now because of work and Uni work.
                    Also boardgames are quite fun, they get you away from the screen and
                    I appreciate how more social it is being face to face.
                    It would be nice to get back into Warhammer but it is so expensive.
