    <h2 class="Games" id="History">My history with gaming</h2>
    <p class="Games">One of my all time favorite hobbies is gaming.
    Ever since I was a kid I have always enjoyed playing or even watching video games.
  My earliest memories of gaming go back to when I was extremely young,
every friday, me and my sister would watch my mum play games all night.
Ever since those days I have always enjoyed gaming as its helped me get through tough times,
made me have some new perspectives on the world and also connect with, not only my friends and family, but also strangers.</p>

<h2 class="Games" id="TLOU">The Last of us</h2>
<p class="Games">The Last of us is my favorite game of all time with such a gripping narrative.
The game is based around the outbreak of a mutated version of an brain infection known as Cordyceps (which is a real infection) which takes over the body and turns people into zombies.
However, unlike other zombie appocalypse stories this game focuses on the relationships between the survivors and shows that when a zombie appocalypse happens the biggest threat is not zombies, but instead other people.
This game is an emotional experience from start to finish as the game begins we get to experience the outbreak as its happening with our main character, Joel, trying to skip town with his daughter, Sarah,
however, the military is making sure that no one escapes the city in order to contain the outbreak.
A soldier ends up shooting Sarah as she is in Joels arms.
Then, we are forced to suffer through the scene of hearing Sarah squeeling and Joel begging for Sarah to not die only for the squeeling to stop and Sarahs face is filled with a blank expression, only to be followed with Joel sobbing as he holds her body up to give her one last hug.</p>

<h2 class="Games" id="KH">Kingdom Hearts</h2>
<p class="Games">Have you ever watched a Disney movie and wondered what it would be like to interact with the characters?
Well Kingdom Hearts is a series based in a universe which is made up of the Disney worlds.
This series of games is a crossover between the gigantic gaming franchise known as Final Fantasy and the massive multi-media company Disney.
The series follows our main character, Sora, along with his two best friends, Riku and Kairi.
Although the first game in the series seperates the trio, with Sora meeting up with Donald and Goofy while finding out that his world is only one in a universe of many others.
Eventually, Sora meets Riku only to find that he has turned to the darkness by the evil witch Maleficent.
By the end of the game Sora finds Kairi while Riku joins Sora's side and fights off the big leader of darkness, known as Ansem.
However, at the end of the game we are left in the same place we started, with all three of our main characters being seperated.
Kairi being left in the destiny islands (their home)
Riku in the world of darkness with king Mickey and Sora in the normal world tasked with finding both Riku and king Mickey.</p>

<h2 class="Games" id="P5">Persona 5</h2>
<p class="Games">Persona 5 follows the story of a High School delinquent, called 'Ren Amamiya' who was walking home from school one day when he found a drunk man harassing a women.
Ren intervenes only to later find out that the drunk man was extremely rich and has connections all around.
Ren ends up getting a criminal record and is expelled from his school.
This leads him to change school meaning he has to move, however, he must move by himself and therefore he has to be taken in by a guardian who will watch over him as he goes through probation.
He moves to the bustling city of Shibuya in order to attend Shujin Academy.
On his first day at Shujin he gets to know another boy while he walks to school before they see the school netball team coach (Kamoshida), who has been known to abuse his team and treat students as toys.
The two students end up somehow being unknowingly transported into a palace where they find a castle ruled by Lord Kamoshida.
Palaces are places based on the distorted cognitions of the leader and shows their perspective on how they see the world.
Throughout the game Ren makes several friends who end up coming to the palaces where each one of these characters, including Ren, awaken their personas which help them fight of the enemies.
Their goal is always to steal the big treassure which motivates the leaders to do the evil things that they do.
Due to the group being based around stealing treassure in non-physical places, the group refer to themselves as the 'Phantom Thieves'.</p>
