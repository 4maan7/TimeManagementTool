<h2 class="Places" id="My_experiences">My experiences</h2>
<p class="Places">Throughout my life I have always enjoyed travelling around the world.
I enjoy observing and experiencing the various cultures and lifestyles around the world.
I find a deep fascination in how different life is depending on where people live,
such as differences between life in the countryside and life in the city.
Or even differences in nature such as temperature which make life harder.</p>

<h2 class="Places" id="Dubai">Dubai</h2>
<p class="Places">I have been to Dubai three times with each time being more entertaining and fun than the last time.
There is an abundance of activities to partake in within Dubai from the various water parks,
to the several landmarks located all around the city.
Dubai houses the tallest skycraper in the world known as the <b>Burj Khalifa</b>.</p>

<h2 class="Places" id="Pakistan">Pakistan</h2>
<p class="Places">I am a Pakistani and therefore, I have been to Pakistan many times.
  My family comes from two different cities within Pakistan.
My Mothers side lives in <b>Faisalabad</b> and my Fathers side lives in <b>Lahore</b>.
I enjoy experiencing the culture of Pakistan as well as seeing how different everything looks,
such as the streets or even the active nightlife.
I last went only a few months ago and also celebrated Eid in Pakistan for the first time.</p>

<h2 class="Places" id="Turkey">Turkey</h2>
<p class="Places">I have only been to Turkey once and, as a muslim,
  there are some religiously and historically significant Mosques.
These include <b>The Blue Mosque</b> and the <b>Hagia Sophia</b>.
These Mosques are both massive and have beautiful designs within the building.
Turkey also houses <b>The Grand Bazaar</b> which is one of the oldest and largest bazaars in the world.
Within the Grand Bazaar there is a beautiful community of people who are always helping each other out whether its getting food, providing tea, or even helping navigate customers around the bazzar.
